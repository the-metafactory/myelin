# RFC-0008: Capability Discovery and Advertisement

## Abstract

This document specifies the myelin capability-discovery wire: the self-signed
`CapabilityAdvertisement` an agent publishes to declare what it can do, and the
`SignedCapabilityRegistration` that wraps it, so that a network can answer
"who is reachable and qualified for this work, right now?" as a query against a
signed registry rather than a static manifest. It specifies the advertisement's
canonical byte representation and Ed25519 verification chain, the
`AGENT_CAPABILITIES` key-value addressing that stores it, the TTL/renewal
contract that makes the registry a liveness signal, and the syntax of the
capability identifier the advertisement carries.

Two mutually incompatible capability-identifier grammars are deployed in the
ecosystem today — a single-segment tag on the myelin task-matching side and a
dotted-compound id on cortex's parallel presence wire — and cortex consumes
none of the myelin discovery API. This document records both wires faithfully,
marks their reconciliation as an unresolved decision rather than inventing one,
and pins the boundary cases (grammar collisions, the shared-tag masking case,
and the unvalidated-advertisement trust gap) as conformance vectors.

## Status of This Memo

This is a **metafactory** RFC. It is not an IETF document and carries no IETF status.

This document is `Draft`. Only a document with status `Ratified` is normative.
Implementations MUST NOT ground behaviour on a `Draft` or `Proposed` document.

A `Ratified` RFC is **immutable**. It is never edited in place. Corrections and changes are
published as a new RFC carrying `Updates: NNNN` or `Obsoletes: NNNN` in its front matter.

Ratification requires the signature of **the principal** and **the hub custodian**, recorded in
`signatories`. A wire contract binds more than one party; it cannot be ratified by one.

The authoritative index of RFCs, their numbers and their statuses is [`specs/README.md`](../README.md).

## 1. Introduction

Layer 5 (Discovery) of the myelin stack makes the answer to *"what capability is
reachable right now?"* a query against a signed registry rather than a static
on-disk manifest. An agent self-advertises a `CapabilityAdvertisement`, signs it
with the same Ed25519 key it registers at L4, and publishes the signed
registration into a key-value store. Consumers list the store, filter by the
capability tags a task requires, and route work. The design shipped as **F-11**
(myelin#50, 2026-05-10).

**What this document specifies.** The advertisement record shape (§2); its
canonicalization and the Ed25519 verification chain, deferring the JCS profile
and clock-skew rule to RFC-0004 (§3); the capability-identifier syntax (§4); the
`AGENT_CAPABILITIES` KV addressing and the TTL/renewal liveness contract (§5).

**What this document does NOT resolve.** The capability identifier is deployed
today as **two incompatible grammars** — myelin's single-segment `capability-tag`
(the grammar the envelope `requirements[]` matching side enforces, RFC-0003) and
cortex's dotted-compound `capability-id` (the grammar its parallel
`agent.capabilities-changed` presence wire enforces). cortex references none of
the myelin F-11 API. This document specifies both faithfully and records the
"converge or retire" choice as an **[OPEN DECISION — Andreas + JC]** (§6.1, §6.2),
because choosing one here would silently break the other's live traffic.

**What this document makes normative.** It promotes the informative
[`docs/discovery.md`](../../docs/discovery.md) (listed in `supersedes_prose`).
Where this document and that prose disagree, this document governs once
`Ratified`.

This document is Standards Track. It normatively references RFC-0001
(identifier terminals — `did`, `lower`), RFC-0002 (subject namespace — the
tasks-domain capability segment and the `dead-letter`/`@` reservations),
RFC-0003 (envelope — the `requirements[]`, `sovereignty_required`, `deadline`,
`distribution_mode`, `target_assistant`, and `economics` fields that consume or
mirror discovery), and RFC-0004 (envelope signing and canonicalization — the
JCS profile, the clock-skew rule, and the SIGNABLE-field doctrine this
document's signed perimeter is measured against).

### 1.1. Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
as shown here.

> **For agents:** a sentence is normative **only** when it contains one of the above keywords in
> all capitals. Lowercase "must" is prose. Do not treat explanatory text as a requirement.

### 1.2. Terminology

- **CapabilityAdvertisement** — the self-asserted record of what an agent can do:
  its actor-DID, its capability set, its sovereignty posture, its current load,
  its concurrency ceiling, and a renewal timestamp (§2). Source:
  `src/discovery/types.ts:10`.
- **SignedCapabilityRegistration** — a `CapabilityAdvertisement` wrapped with an
  Ed25519 `signed_by` stamp; the object the registry actually stores. Source:
  `src/discovery/types.ts:27`.
- **advertisement actor-DID** — the `identity` field of the advertisement; a
  `did` (RFC-0001). During the R2 transition window a pre-migration
  advertisement MAY carry the deprecated `principal` key instead;
  RFC-0001 terms apply to the value.
- **capability-tag** — a single-segment capability identifier: `CAPABILITY_TAG_RE`
  (`src/patterns.ts:21`). The grammar the envelope `requirements[]` items enforce
  (RFC-0003). Defined in §4.
- **capability-id-compound** — cortex's dotted-compound capability identifier:
  `CAPABILITY_ID_REGEX` (cortex `src/common/types/capability.ts:172`). Defined in §4.
- **capability-id** — the abstract identifier carried in an advertisement's
  `capabilities[]`. Its concrete grammar is unresolved (§6.1); until then it is
  the union of the two above, and is unvalidated at the myelin trust boundary
  (§9.1).
- **sovereignty mode** — one of `open | selective | strict | bidding`; the
  advertisement's declared posture and the envelope `sovereignty_required`
  minimum (RFC-0003). Source: `src/discovery/types.ts:7`.
- **load** — a self-reported `[0,1]` utilization figure, clamped at registration.
- **maxConcurrent** — a positive-integer hard ceiling on parallel tasks.
- **AGENT_CAPABILITIES KV** — the key-value bucket the registry is stored in
  (§5). Named only in an informative doc today; reserved by this document.
- **TTL / renewal** — the registration's time bound (60 s) and re-publish cadence
  (30 s) that turn presence-in-the-registry into a liveness signal (§5).
- **self-registration** — the property that discovery is signed only by the
  advertising agent; hub-stamping (RFC-0004) is deliberately not supported here.

Terms defined in a referenced RFC (`did`, `lower`, `DIGIT`, JCS, `signed_by`
stamp, hub-stamp, SIGNABLE fields, clock skew) are cited, not redefined.

## 2. The Capability Advertisement

A `CapabilityAdvertisement` is a JSON object [RFC8259] with the following
members. This section states the shape; §3 states how it is signed and verified,
§4 the capability-id syntax, §5 the storage.

| Member | Type | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `identity` | string (`did`, RFC-0001) | REQUIRED. The advertising agent's actor-DID. MUST equal the signing stamp's DID (§3). |
| `capabilities` | array of capability-id (§4) | REQUIRED. The capability set the agent advertises. MAY be empty (an agent that is up but claims nothing). |
| `sovereignty` | sovereignty mode | REQUIRED. One of `open`, `selective`, `strict`, `bidding`. |
| `load` | number in `[0,1]` | REQUIRED. Self-reported utilization; clamped to `[0,1]` at registration (§3). |
| `maxConcurrent` | integer ≥ 1 | REQUIRED. Hard ceiling on parallel tasks. |
| `updatedAt` | string (ISO-8601) | REQUIRED. Renewal timestamp; drives liveness with the TTL (§5). |

The reference type is `src/discovery/types.ts:10-25`. A conforming producer
MUST emit the canonical `identity` key for the actor-DID; it MUST NOT emit the
deprecated `principal` key. A conforming consumer, during the R2 transition
window, MUST accept a pre-migration advertisement carrying `principal` in place
of `identity`, and MUST reject an advertisement carrying BOTH keys with the
stable reason `dual_field_conflict` (§3).

A `SignedCapabilityRegistration` is a JSON object with exactly two members:

| Member | Type | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `advertisement` | CapabilityAdvertisement | REQUIRED. |
| `signed_by` | Ed25519 stamp (RFC-0004) | REQUIRED. `method: "ed25519"`, `identity` (a `did`), `signature` (base64), `at` (ISO-8601). |

Reference: `src/discovery/types.ts:27-33`. The registration is
**self-registration only**: `signed_by` MUST be a single Ed25519 stamp signed by
the advertising agent's own key. A hub-stamp (RFC-0004) MUST NOT be used to
attest a capability claim — a hub attesting to a capability it cannot itself
perform would defeat the verification model (`docs/discovery.md`, "Self-registration
only"). Note that this document does NOT constrain the `advertisement.capabilities`
values against any grammar at the signing or verification boundary; that gap is
§9.1 and OPEN DECISION §6.4.

---

## 3. Signing, Canonicalization, and Verification

### 3.1. Canonical bytes

The bytes an advertisement is signed over are the RFC 8785 JCS serialization of
the **`advertisement` object only**, encoded UTF-8. The reference is
`canonicalizeAdvertisement` (`src/discovery/canonicalize.ts:9`), which delegates
to the shared `canonicalStringify` (`src/jcs.ts`). The JCS profile — object-key
ordering, number formatting, string escaping, and the deviations recorded for
the envelope — is specified in **RFC-0004** and MUST be identical here; a JCS
change in RFC-0004 propagates to this document by construction (the primitive is
shared).

The `signed_by` stamp is **NOT** part of the signed bytes: only the
`advertisement` is canonicalized (`src/discovery/register.ts:82-84`). This is a
**divergent signed perimeter** from the envelope (RFC-0004), where each stamp
commits to the prior chain slice, and from the bidding `BidResponse`, where the
stamp's timestamp is inside the signed bytes. The divergence is a finding, not a
design endorsement — §9.2.

The advertisement MUST be canonicalized **bytes-as-received** — never re-keyed.
A pre-migration advertisement carrying `principal` was signed over bytes
containing the string `"principal"`; a verifier MUST canonicalize that same key
to reproduce the signed bytes. The reference reader
(`src/discovery/advertisement-identity.ts`) reads the actor-DID through either
key but never rewrites it before canonicalization.

### 3.2. Signing

`signCapabilityRegistration` (`src/discovery/register.ts:39`) validates, then
signs. A conforming signer:

- MUST resolve the advertisement actor-DID through the dual-field reader and MUST
  reject a both-keys advertisement with `dual_field_conflict` before signing.
- MUST reject an actor-DID that is not a valid `did` (RFC-0001).
- MUST reject when `advertisement.identity` does not equal the signing identity's
  DID (`register.ts:52`) — an agent MUST NOT sign a registration for another
  agent's identity.
- MUST reject `maxConcurrent` that is not an integer ≥ 1 (`register.ts:58`).
- MUST clamp `load` to `[0,1]` and MUST reject a non-finite `load`
  (`register.ts:11-18`).
- MUST sign the canonical bytes (§3.1) with a 32-byte Ed25519 private key
  [RFC8032] and emit the base64 signature in `signed_by.signature`.

The signer does **not** validate `advertisement.capabilities`, `sovereignty`, or
`updatedAt` format (`register.ts` performs none of these checks). That is the
trust-boundary gap of §9.1.

### 3.3. Verification

`verifyCapabilityRegistration` (`src/discovery/verify.ts:31`) is the receive-side
contract. A conforming verifier MUST, in order:

1. Resolve the advertisement actor-DID through the dual-field reader; if the
   advertisement carries both keys, REJECT with `dual_field_conflict`
   (`verify.ts:44-47`).
2. REJECT unless the signing stamp DID equals the advertisement actor-DID
   (anti-spoof; `verify.ts:56-62`), with reason `identity-mismatch`.
3. Resolve the public key from the L4 `IdentityRegistry` (RFC-0004); REJECT an
   unknown identity (`verify.ts:64-67`).
4. REJECT when `signed_by.at` is unparseable or drifts from the verifier's clock
   by more than the tolerance (`verify.ts:69-77`). The default tolerance is
   **5 minutes** (`DEFAULT_CLOCK_SKEW_MS`, `verify.ts:9`); the tolerance and its
   replay implications are RFC-0004's contract and MUST match it.
5. REJECT unless the Ed25519 signature verifies over the canonical bytes of the
   advertisement (`verify.ts:88-99`).

Rejection is final; there is no permissive path (`docs/discovery.md`, "Rejection
is final"). Verification checks WHO signed and that the bytes are intact; it does
**not** check that the advertised capabilities are well-formed, that
`sovereignty` is within the enum, that `load` is in range, or that `updatedAt`
parses (`verify.ts` performs none of these). Consequently a syntactically
malformed advertisement, correctly signed, VERIFIES today — §9.1, and the
`advertisement/ungrammatical-capabilities-verify-gap` vector (Appendix B).

## 4. Capability Identifier Grammar

### 4.1. The two deployed grammars

The identifier carried in `capabilities[]` is deployed today as **two
incompatible grammars**. This document transcribes both faithfully. Neither is
adopted as the target — that is OPEN DECISION §6.1.

**capability-tag** — the single-segment tag, `CAPABILITY_TAG_RE`
(`src/patterns.ts:21`, `/^[a-z](?:[a-z0-9]|-(?!-)){0,62}[a-z0-9]$/`). It is the
grammar the envelope `requirements[]` items enforce (RFC-0003, schema `line 154`)
and therefore the grammar every task-side match is written against. It admits
2–64 characters, a leading letter, a trailing alphanumeric, and interior single
hyphens; it forbids `.`, `_`, leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens, and
single-character tags.

**capability-id-compound** — cortex's dotted-compound id, `CAPABILITY_ID_REGEX`
(cortex `src/common/types/capability.ts:172`,
`/^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*(\.[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*)*$/`). It admits `.`-separated segments,
each segment starting with a letter and then any of `[a-z0-9_-]` — permitting
`_`, consecutive hyphens, and trailing hyphens that the tag forbids, and using
`.` to span **multiple NATS subject segments**. cortex's live production ids
`dev.implement` and `federated.subject_dispatch` are valid here and
**unexpressible as a capability-tag**.

The full ABNF is in Appendix A / `specs/grammar/capability-discovery.abnf`. The
`did` and `lower` terminals it references are RFC-0001's and MUST NOT be
redefined here.

### 4.2. The C-3 incompatibility

Because the myelin task side (`requirements[]`) matches on capability-tag while
cortex advertises capability-id-compound, a capability an agent advertises can be
**unmatchable** by a task that needs it. `code_review` (underscore) and
`dev.implement` (dot) advertise fine on the cortex wire and fail the myelin tag
grammar outright. Even a shared-looking id diverges in *match semantics*: a task
requiring the tag `code-review` does not match an agent advertising
`code-review.typescript` under myelin's exact-membership match
(`docs/discovery.md`: `caps.includes(tag)`), though cortex's prefix-matching
would. The masking hazard is that `code-review` — a seed-taxonomy tag valid under
**both** grammars — makes a naive interop test pass and hides all of the above
(the `capability-id/masking-shared-tag` vector, Appendix B).

A third, looser grammar appears in prose: `namespace.md:318` (RFC-0002's source)
states the validator "accepts any token matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` (max 64
chars)", which admits 1-char tags and trailing hyphens the canonical
`CAPABILITY_TAG_RE` rejects. Where the two disagree, the ABNF governs and the
prose is a defect (per the grounding contract); RFC-0002's ratification is
expected to reconcile its prose to the capability-tag ABNF defined here.

### 4.3. Reserved capability tags

RFC-0002 (namespace) reserves two capability positions: a tag MUST NOT start with
`@` (the Direct/Delegate assistant-address form) and a tag MUST NOT equal
`dead-letter` (the unclaimable-task escalation path) — `namespace.md:165-174`.
Those reservations are owned by RFC-0002; this document references them and a
conforming discovery producer MUST NOT advertise a capability tag that violates
them. **Finding:** neither reservation is enforced in code today — `dead-letter`
satisfies `CAPABILITY_TAG_RE` and reaches the escalation subject builder
unblocked (`src/subjects.ts:304-306`). This is a runtime-guard gap recorded in
§9.4, and the `capability-tag/dead-letter-grammar-accepts` vector pins it.

---

## 5. `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` Key-Value Addressing

### 5.1. The bucket and key

The registry is a key-value bucket named **`AGENT_CAPABILITIES`**
(`docs/design-agent-task-routing.md:293`; referenced from the envelope
`requirements` description, RFC-0003 schema, as "Match against AGENT_CAPABILITIES
KV (myelin#9)"). This document reserves the bucket name (§8).

The shipped store keys each `SignedCapabilityRegistration` by the **advertisement
actor-DID** (`src/discovery/memory-store.ts:47-52`) — e.g. `did:mf:luna`. A
conforming store MUST key by the actor-DID resolved through the dual-field reader
and MUST reject a both-keys advertisement on write (`memory-store.ts:48-53`).

**[OPEN DECISION — Andreas — see §6.3]** The informative design doc addresses
the same record by agent **short-name** (`"luna"`) with a separate `principal`
field (`docs/design-agent-task-routing.md:293-297`), contradicting the shipped
DID-keyed store. The `advertisement-kv-key` ABNF rule binds to `did` (the shipped
form) pending this decision.

The abstract store interface — `put` / `get` / `delete` / `list` / `watch` /
`close` — is `src/discovery/store.ts`. `list()` is the primary query path;
capability and sovereignty filtering happen client-side over the listed set
(`docs/discovery.md`, "Querying"). A server-side filter API is deferred. The
canonical production store is NATS KV (`NATSCapabilityStore`, deferred to a
follow-up); the shipped `InMemoryCapabilityStore` is not TTL-aware (§5.2).

### 5.2. TTL and renewal liveness contract

Registrations are time-bounded. The deployed F-11 contract
(`docs/discovery.md`, "TTL & liveness"):

| Knob | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| TTL | 60 seconds | A registration expires 60 s after its last write. |
| Renewal | 30 seconds | The agent re-publishes at half-TTL. |

A conforming agent SHOULD renew its registration at an interval no greater than
half the TTL, so a single missed beat does not evict a live agent. `updateLoad`
(`src/discovery/register.ts:110`) re-signs and re-publishes with a fresh
`updatedAt`; it doubles as the renewal heartbeat when load is unchanged. TTL
expiry is the responsibility of the backing store, NOT of this format: the
in-memory store is explicitly not TTL-aware, and NATS KV per-key expiration
enforces it in the canonical implementation. A verifier therefore MUST NOT treat
presence-in-the-store as freshness on its own — the `signed_by.at` clock-skew
check (§3.3 step 4) is the format-level freshness bound; TTL is the
store-level liveness bound. An agent that crashes silently stops renewing; its
entry expires within one TTL window and consumers observe the absence.

---

## 6. Open Decisions

The following are unresolved. Each is marked in place above and MUST be resolved
by a subsequent RFC (or an update to this one before ratification). None is
invented here.

### 6.1. Capability-id grammar convergence (the C-3 incompatibility)

**[OPEN DECISION — Andreas + JC — blocked on an unfiled capability-id
reconciliation issue.]** myelin's task side enforces `capability-tag`
(single-segment); cortex's presence side enforces `capability-id-compound`
(dotted, underscore-bearing). Candidate resolutions, presented not chosen:

- **Converge-widen** — myelin adopts the compound grammar for `requirements[]`
  and `capabilities[]`; cost: `.` in a capability spans multiple NATS subject
  segments and must be reconciled with the tasks-domain subject grammar (RFC-0002).
- **Converge-narrow** — cortex retires `_` and `.` from its capability ids and
  migrates `dev.implement` / `federated.subject_dispatch`; cost: breaking change
  to live cortex traffic.
- **Bridge** — a specified, lossless mapping between the two at the M5/M7 seam;
  cost: a third artifact to keep in sync.

Until resolved, the ABNF `capability-id` rule is a placeholder (the union of both
grammars) and cross-wire capability matching is undefined.

### 6.2. Which discovery wire is canonical

**[OPEN DECISION — Andreas + JC.]** cortex consumes none of myelin's F-11 API
(zero references to `registerCapabilities` / `CapabilityAdvertisement` /
`SignedCapabilityRegistration` / `verifyCapabilityRegistration` on cortex
origin/main) and instead ships a parallel push-model wire
(`agent.capabilities-changed`, §7). Decide whether F-11 is the normative
discovery wire (cortex adopts it), the presence wire is (F-11 retires), or a
specified adapter bridges them.

### 6.3. `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` key grammar

**[OPEN DECISION — Andreas.]** DID-keyed (shipped store) vs short-name-keyed
(design doc). §5.1.

### 6.4. Advertisement shape validation at the trust boundary

**[OPEN DECISION — Andreas + JC — blocked on §6.1.]** Whether
`verifyCapabilityRegistration` MUST validate each `capabilities[]` entry (against
which grammar depends on §6.1), bound `sovereignty` to its enum, and range-check
`load`/`maxConcurrent`. §9.1.

### 6.5. `sovereignty_required` matching semantics

**[OPEN DECISION — Andreas + JC.]** The four modes imply a "minimum" ordering the
source never defines (does `strict` satisfy `selective`? where does `bidding`
sit?). Define the partial order or declare equality-matched. The only reference
is an undefined `matchesSovereigntyMode` helper in an informative doc snippet
(`docs/discovery.md:155`).

---

## 7. Relationship to the cortex Presence Wire (Informative)

*This section is informative.*

cortex M7 ships an independent capability-advertisement wire that this document
does not govern but must be read against. It is the `agent`-domain presence
protocol (ADR-0007): `agent.online` carries the initial capability set and
`agent.capabilities-changed` carries deltas, on subjects
`{scope}.{principal}.{stack}.agent.{action}` (cortex
`src/bus/agent-network/envelopes.ts:75`, `builders.ts:288`). The presence
registry folds these into per-agent snapshots (`src/bus/agent-network/registry.ts`).
Its capability ids are validated by `capability-id-compound`
(cortex `src/common/types/capability.ts:172`; duplicated for the presence
payload at `src/bus/agent-network/envelopes.ts:102`).

This is a **push** model (agents announce deltas; subscribers fold) where F-11 is
a **pull** model (agents write to KV; consumers list). They differ in transport,
in liveness mechanism (presence TTL FSM vs KV TTL), and — the load-bearing
divergence — in capability grammar (§4.2). §6.1 and §6.2 own the reconciliation.

---

## 8. Registry Considerations

- **RFC number.** This document is allocated RFC-0008 in
  [`specs/README.md`](../README.md); numbers are never reused.
- **Reserved KV bucket name.** This document reserves **`AGENT_CAPABILITIES`** as
  the key-value bucket for signed capability registrations (§5).
- **Reserved capability positions.** The `@`-prefixed and `dead-letter`
  capability-tag reservations are owned by RFC-0002 (namespace); this document
  references them (§4.3) and reserves nothing new in the subject namespace.
- **External registries.** This document defines no DID method and registers
  nothing in the W3C DID Specification Registries; the `did:mf` method is
  RFC-0001's concern.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

REQUIRED. This section states where a property is held by a runtime check rather
than by the format — an invariant held shut by vigilance is a finding, not a
design.

### 9.1. Advertisement shape is unvalidated at the trust boundary (runtime-guard gap)

`verifyCapabilityRegistration` (`src/discovery/verify.ts`) validates the signer,
the registry resolution, the clock skew, and the Ed25519 signature — and nothing
about the advertisement's content. `capabilities[]` entries are checked against no
grammar; `sovereignty` is a TypeScript-type-only constraint erased at runtime;
`load` and `maxConcurrent` are unchecked at verify time (they are only checked
and clamped by `signCapabilityRegistration` on the *signing* side,
`register.ts:11-18,58`, which an off-path forger bypasses); `updatedAt` format is
unchecked. Therefore a syntactically malformed but correctly signed advertisement
— ungrammatical tags, reserved `dead-letter`, out-of-range `load`, a
non-enum `sovereignty` — VERIFIES today (the
`advertisement/ungrammatical-capabilities-verify-gap` and
`advertisement/load-clamped-on-register` vectors). Consumers that embed a
capability tag into a NATS subject or KV key downstream inherit whatever the
advertiser wrote, including strings that are illegal or wildcard-adjacent in
those positions. This is a **format vs runtime-guard** gap: nothing in the wire
format constrains the content, and the only partial guard runs on the wrong side
of the trust boundary. Closing it is OPEN DECISION §6.4; the grammar to validate
against is blocked on §6.1.

### 9.2. Divergent, unwritten signed perimeter

The advertisement signs `JCS(advertisement)` with the `signed_by` stamp
**excluded** from the signed bytes (`register.ts:82-84`), whereas the envelope
(RFC-0004) commits each stamp to the prior chain slice, and the bidding
`BidResponse` folds the stamp timestamp into the signed bytes. Three signed
artifacts, three different perimeters, none of them previously written down. A
consumer that assumes envelope-style chain semantics for a discovery record — for
example, expecting the stamp `at` to be signed — is wrong. Because the stamp is
outside the signed bytes, the stamp's `at` is malleable by anyone who can rewrite
the unsigned wrapper; the clock-skew check (§3.3 step 4) is what bounds a
replayed advertisement's freshness, not a signature over `at`. The exact JCS
profile and the base64 signature canonicalization caveats are RFC-0004's; this
document inherits them and MUST NOT restate them divergently.

### 9.3. Two parallel wires that do not reconcile

Because cortex advertises on `agent.capabilities-changed` (§7) and consumes none
of F-11, an agent visible on one wire is invisible on the other. A dispatcher
that queries only the F-11 KV sees no cortex-advertised agents, and vice versa. A
network that runs both silently partitions its capability view. This is not a
format flaw the vectors can catch — it is an architectural gap owned by §6.2 —
but it is a security-relevant availability property: capability-based routing
decisions made against a partitioned registry are made against a false picture of
the fleet.

### 9.4. Reserved-tag reservations are unenforced

`namespace.md:172-174` (RFC-0002) declares a capability tag equal to
`dead-letter`, or starting with `@`, a publish-time validation error. No code
enforces it: `dead-letter` satisfies `CAPABILITY_TAG_RE` and reaches the
dead-letter escalation subject builder (`src/subjects.ts:304-306`) unblocked. An
advertiser or task publisher can therefore inject work onto the escalation path
by naming a capability `dead-letter`. Enforcement is a runtime guard that does
not exist; the format alone does not hold the invariant. RFC-0002 owns the fix;
this document records the gap and pins it with a vector.

### 9.5. Self-registration: capability claims are attested by no third party

Discovery is self-registration only (§2). The verification model proves *who
signed* the advertisement, not that the signer *can perform* the advertised
capabilities. A compromised or dishonest agent key can advertise arbitrary
capabilities and a verifier will accept them; nothing on the wire attests
competence. This is intentional (`docs/discovery.md`, "Self-registration only":
a hub attesting a capability it cannot perform would be worse), but it means
capability match is an availability/routing signal, not an authorization
decision. Authorization on top of capability match is explicitly out of scope and
belongs to per-network policy at M7 (`docs/discovery.md`, "Out of scope").

### 9.6. Economics is a mutable, unsigned annotation

The envelope `economics` block (RFC-0003 schema; the F-15 half of this audit
dimension) is outside the SIGNABLE fields (RFC-0004) and carries
`additionalProperties: true` with no size bound. It MUST NOT inform any security
or trust decision (`schemas/envelope.schema.json`, economics description:
"MUST NOT inform security or trust decisions"). A capability-routing or bidding
implementation MUST treat `economics.budget` / `economics.actual` as an unsigned
hint an intermediary may have altered, never as a signed constraint. This
document does not own the economics block (RFC-0003 does) but records the
constraint because discovery-adjacent bidding consumes it.

### 9.7. Unbounded advertisement content

`capabilities[]` has no maximum length or item-count bound expressed at the
discovery boundary (contrast the envelope `requirements[]` `maxItems: 10`,
RFC-0003), and JCS canonicalization has no depth/width cap (RFC-0004). A verifier
processing attacker-supplied registrations SHOULD bound the work it will do per
record; this document does not yet specify the bound (tracked with the §6.4
validation decision).

## 10. Privacy Considerations

REQUIRED for any document that specifies an identifier. This document specifies
the advertisement actor-DID (a `did`), the capability tags, and the
`AGENT_CAPABILITIES` KV key.

- **The registry is a capability disclosure surface.** Any party with read access
  to `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` (or to the `agent.capabilities-changed` stream, §7) can
  enumerate every agent's DID and full declared capability set. Capability tags
  can be organizationally revealing (`security-scan`, a niche domain tag).
- **The DID is a stable cross-context correlator.** The KV key is the actor-DID
  (§5.1), so an observer can correlate an agent's capability set, `load`
  trajectory, and renewal cadence across every registration under one stable
  identifier. The DID class-collision and injectivity concerns are RFC-0001's;
  they apply to the key here by reference.
- **`load` is an activity side channel.** A self-reported `[0,1]` utilization,
  re-published every ~30 s, discloses an agent's real-time busyness to anyone
  watching the registry — a timing/activity oracle independent of any task
  payload.
- **`updatedAt` / renewal cadence leaks liveness and uptime patterns.** The
  30 s renewal beat makes an agent's presence, restarts, and outages observable
  to any registry reader (the intended liveness signal is also an availability
  side channel).
- **Cross-network containment.** Each network owns its own registry; a capability
  set does not cross a network boundary except via an explicit federation
  handshake, never a registry merge (`docs/discovery.md`, "Out of scope";
  architecture §5.4). A conforming implementation MUST NOT replicate one
  network's `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` into another's without that handshake. This
  bounds the disclosure surface to a single network's readers.

---

## 11. Conformance

An implementation conforms to this document if and only if it passes every vector
under the path named in `vectors` (`specs/vectors/capability-discovery/`). Prose
explains; **vectors bind.**

A conforming implementation MUST, using its **own** parser and verifier (not an
import of the myelin reference):

1. Accept exactly the `capability-tag` language and reject everything else, per
   the `parseCapabilityTag` vectors — including rejecting single-char,
   uppercase, underscore, dot, digit-prefix, and consecutive/trailing-hyphen
   inputs.
2. Recognise the `capability-id-compound` language for the cortex-side ids, per
   the `parseCapabilityIdCompound` vectors.
3. Reproduce the cross-grammar masking result (`crossGrammarAgreement`) — i.e.
   demonstrate that a shared seed tag is accepted by both grammars and is
   therefore not a sufficient interop test on its own.
4. Enforce the verification chain (§3.3): reject `identity-mismatch` and
   `dual_field_conflict`; reject non-positive `maxConcurrent`; clamp `load`.

The `advertisement/ungrammatical-capabilities-verify-gap` and
`capability-tag/dead-letter-grammar-accepts` vectors pin **current** behaviour
(the §9.1 and §9.4 gaps). They carry an explicit `why` recording that they flip
to a rejection once OPEN DECISION §6.4 / RFC-0002 enforcement lands — a
change-log event, never a silent edit.

The complete grammar, reproduced for the reader. **This appendix is a copy.** The

## Appendix B. Test Vectors

Vectors live as JSON under `specs/vectors/capability-discovery/` so
implementations in any language can consume them; each carries a `why`. This
appendix reproduces a representative subset — it is not the only copy. See
[`specs/vectors/README.md`](../vectors/README.md) for the schema. The full set is
20 vectors covering the capability-tag accept/reject language, the cortex
compound ids, the shared-tag **masking** case, the underscore/dot **C-3
collision** pair, and the advertisement verification chain (identity-mismatch,
dual_field_conflict, maxConcurrent, load-clamp, and the §9.1 unvalidated-shape
gap).

```jsonc
// The C-3 incompatibility — an id valid under exactly one grammar:
{
  "id": "capability-tag/underscore-rejected-C3",
  "rfc": 8, "kind": "parseCapabilityTag", "input": "code_review",
  "expect": { "ok": false, "reason": "underscore-not-allowed" },
  "why": "cortex CAPABILITY_ID_REGEX ACCEPTS '_'; the myelin capability-tag REJECTS it. Blocked on OPEN DECISION §6.1."
}
// The masking case — a shared tag that hides the incompatibility:
{
  "id": "capability-id/masking-shared-tag",
  "rfc": 8, "kind": "crossGrammarAgreement", "input": "code-review",
  "expect": { "ok": true, "value": { "acceptedByTag": true, "acceptedByCompound": true } },
  "why": "Accepted by BOTH grammars, so an interop test drawn only from the shared seed taxonomy PASSES and HIDES the C-3 incompatibility."
}
// The trust-boundary gap — a malformed advertisement that verifies today:
{
  "id": "advertisement/ungrammatical-capabilities-verify-gap",
  "rfc": 8, "kind": "verifyCapabilityRegistration",
  "input": { "advertisement": { "identity": "did:mf:luna", "capabilities": ["code_review","dead-letter","Bad--Tag"], "sovereignty": "selective", "load": 0.2, "maxConcurrent": 4, "updatedAt": "2026-07-12T00:00:00Z" }, "signed_by": { "method": "ed25519", "identity": "did:mf:luna", "signature": "<valid-over-canonical-bytes>", "at": "2026-07-12T00:00:00Z" } },
  "expect": { "ok": true, "value": { "identity": "did:mf:luna" } },
  "why": "SECURITY GAP §9.1 — capabilities[] is validated against no grammar; a malformed advertisement VERIFIES. Flips to ok:false once §6.4 lands."
}
```

## Appendix C. Change Log

A `Draft` MAY be edited; every substantive edit is logged here.
A `Ratified` RFC is frozen; changes ship as a new RFC.

| Date | Status | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-12 | Draft | Initial draft. Specifies the F-11 CapabilityAdvertisement / SignedCapabilityRegistration shape, JCS+Ed25519 verification chain (deferring the profile to RFC-0004), AGENT_CAPABILITIES KV addressing, and the 60s/30s TTL/renewal contract. Records the capability-tag vs cortex capability-id-compound C-3 incompatibility and the two-parallel-wires gap as OPEN DECISIONS. Promotes docs/discovery.md. 20 conformance vectors (masking + C-3 collision + verify chain + trust-boundary gap). |

## Acknowledgments

This document is grounded in the recovered wire-protocol audit (discovery-econ
dimension) and the F-11 reference implementation (myelin#50). The C-3
incompatibility and the unvalidated-advertisement finding were surfaced by that
audit.
